# Identifying Anti-immigration movements: Mapping Hate Crimes and Groups in the US

We use U.S. public data to identify hate groups and hate crimes towards immigrants or hispanic/Latino groups.

## 1. Data
In the folder [data](/data), we have three data sets:  
    *splc-hate-groups.csv: refers to the identified hate groups since 2000 by the Southern Poverty Law Center
    *ucr_hatecrimes.csv: refers to all the reported hate crimes in the US by the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) from FBI
    *extremism_incidents.csv: refers to all the identified hate-related incidents since 2002 by the ADL (Anti-Defamation League)
